Howdy! I am Jumana MP, an **embedded systems engineer** by education and **system performance analysis engineer** by profession. I currently work for [arm](https://www.arm.com) as a **device performance analysis engineer** looking at performance of mobile and large screen compute devices.
I am a huge fan of **computer architecture** and I like to analyze performance of machines and how they perform together with operatings sytems and application software in System-on-Chips. I tend to look at multiple domains of computing including smart phone applications,
computer vision workloads, and very lately started analyzing server workloads using juju charms deployed on MAAS devices. I **aspire** to be an efficient systm performance analyst for which I keep tracing enhancements in both hardware and software domains.


**Automotive** industry has caught my attention lately as it is a disruptive technical mission which requires a new system design from scratch. Demands for new kinds of hardware, operating systems as well heavy computing capability for deep learning etc makes it quite exciting. For a system engineer, this looks like a great field to get hands dirty with to learn how all these aspects are being designed and investigate the problem areas, especially performance. Following this enthusiasm, I enrolled as a student of Udacity for the **Self-Driving-Car-Nanodegree** program. This course is more about the software being deployed, but with my expertise I keep following the harwdare and Operating Systems in this field. Hence, this blog is my way of updating the knowledge I gain in this field as time passes.

I am a big foodie and spends my free time either making new travel plans or travelling. I sincerely aspire to work towards encouraging and promoting girls into tech/programming when my time comes.
