Howdy! I am Jumana MP, an **Embedded Systems Engineer** by education and **System Architect/Performance analyst** by profession. I currently work for [arm](https://www.arm.com) as a **systtem architect** looking at architecting future SoC solutions for mobile and large screen compute devices, by diving deeper into the real-world usecases.
I am a huge fan of **computer architecture** and I like to analyze performance of machines, especially ow they perform together with operatings sytems and application software in System-on-Chips. I tend to look at multiple domains of computing including smart phone applications, computer vision workloads, and very lately started analyzing server workloads. I **aspire** to be an efficient system performance analyst for which I keep tracing enhancements in both hardware and software domains.


**Automotive** industry has caught my attention lately as it is a disruptive technical mission which requires a new system design from scratch. Demands for new kinds of hardware, operating systems as well heavy computing capability for deep learning etc makes it quite exciting. For a system engineer, this looks like a great field to get hands dirty with understanding how all these elements of the system are being designed and investigating the potential weak/problem areas especially reagrding performance. Following this enthusiasm, I enrolled as a student of Udacity for the **Self-Driving-Car-Nanodegree** program. This course is more about the software being deployed, but with my expertise I keep following the new trends in hardware and Operating Systems design trageted at this field. Hence, this blog is my way of updating the knowledge I gain in this field as time passes.

As much as I like exploring and communicating tech, I also enjoy engaging in a lot of recreational activities both indoor and outdoor. 
Apart from workouts and yoga, I like playing cards and board games. I love traveling and I wish to cover maximum of planet earth before 
I am gone.

I sincerely aspire to work towards encouraging and promoting girls into tech/programming. I do not have a solid plan yet, but is one of the major ones in my bucket list for my 30's.
