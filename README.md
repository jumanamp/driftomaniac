## Preface

Hosting [Creating a Driftomaniac Software](https://jumanamp.github.io/driftomaniac/) blogs on projects done as part of [Self Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=google_search_alpha_nanodegree&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2Y_UBRCGARIsALglqQ1E8Esg4PaFs7C1_PvfF0fI5uLucr2F624vn5158WzhsDfL5EiJjggaAnm_EALw_wcB). Moreover, I would like to add additional information gathered from both academia and industry while following the course and executing the projects.

I hope you enjoy!
